# RegressionModels
Data Science Procedures for Regression Models
There are various kinds of regression techniques available to make predictions. These techniques are mostly driven by three metrics (number of independent variables, type of dependent variables and shape of regression line)

What are the types of Regressions?
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Stepwise Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Robust Regression (Huber & Random Sample Consensus RANSAC & Theil Sen Regression Models)

Features of Regression Models
There must be linear relationship between independent and dependent variables
Multiple regression suffers from multicollinearity, autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity.
Linear Regression is very sensitive to Outliers. It can terribly affect the regression line and eventually the forecasted values.
Multicollinearity can increase the variance of the coefficient estimates and make the estimates very sensitive to minor changes in the model. The result is that the coefficient estimates are unstable
In case of multiple independent variables, we can go with forward selection, backward elimination and step wise approach for selection of most significant independent variables.
It is generally good to normalise the features for regression - Anything from the Gaussian family will be underpinned by the normality assumption

## Project Title
