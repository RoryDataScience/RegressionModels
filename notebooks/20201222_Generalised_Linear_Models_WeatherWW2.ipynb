    "Aerial Bombing Operations in WW2 - Bombing operations data <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of digitized paper mission reports from WWII. Each record includes the date, conflict, geographic location, and other data elements to form a live-action sequence of air warfare from 1939 to 1945. The records include U.S. and Royal Air Force data, in addition to some Australian, New Zealand and South African air force missions.\n",

    "Weather Conditions in WW2 (Weather Stations / Weather Conditions) <br>\n",
    "The dataset contains information on weather conditions recorded on each day at various weather stations around the world. Information includes precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed and whether the day included thunder storms or other poor weather conditions.\n",

    "Use Sweetviz - A powerful package to speed up EDA, saving reports as HTML files and with the ability to compare test and train datasets \n",
